# Poshify
# poshify.me
Gives you outfits fast using machine learning. Utilizes Flask, Tensorflow, DynamoDB, JS, Docker, and other libraries and frameworks. To host, we used AWS and various AWS tools to be efficient and scalable.

# WE LOVE SUSTAINABILITY
The average piece of clothing is worn only 7 times! To promote sustainability, we are following the 30-wear pledge. Poshify incentivizes users to wear clothing they usually wouldn't wear by generating outfit ideas for them. Using our scheduling algorithm, we also can track the number of times you have worn an outfit and recommend when to wash it. Overwashing clothes causes wear and tear and results in more clothes being trashed.

Log into the site using Google (We will create the database for Poshify users in future development). You can add clothes using your camera or by uploading a file. Our algorithm will use statistical fuzzy algorithms to generate outfits based on themes we have given. The outfits can then be selected by the user to be worn on select days.
